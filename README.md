# Scholarship Program

One of the state governments introduced the new scholarship program to help the covid hit students. They have chosen one particular school and reached out to them to filter out the students. Scholarship will be given to the students who meet the criteria such as income level, academic scores etc. This criteria will be shared by the provider to school.  

> As a developer you need to build simple `API` based applications. Students are trained to use postman to apply for scholarships, so there is NO need to build UI. 

### Few key points to consider
  - The school has 50k kids, so max of 50,000 applications will be submitted to the program. 
  - Since this is the one time program, this application will be scrapped after all the applications are processedLow cost will be highly encouraged
